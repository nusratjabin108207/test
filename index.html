                Everyone has his own specific mission in life; everyone must carry out a concrete assignment that
                demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone's
                task is unique as is his specific opportunity to implement

            <p>

                A shared vision of the "good life" is never complete, but is always adapting; it should be "in
                harmony with the human condition," which means that it encompasses suffering, loss and conflict as
                well as pleasures, reverence and common goals of improvement.

            <p>
                There are countless times when life doesnâ€™t go your way. It is useless to fight it, so you just need
                to accept and embrace whatever life has in store as part of loss and conflict as
                loss and conflict as whatever life has "good life"

                Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network). ... Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main
                non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.

                Connecting to the global community fosters education, collaboration, and the birth of
                mutually-beneficial programs that make an impact. On the micro level, keeping oneself connected to the
                global community requires a conscious decision. We can easily live inside a bubble without us even
                knowing it.
